Lab 3 for CSCI370, done by Ian Walker and Fin Lockert.

Name: Carrot Crazy

Objective: The intent of this game is to let players make their way through a world using keyboard controls. They will have a goal of collecting 30 carrots.

Narrative Structure: The player plays a "strapping your rabbit" and is asked by an elder rabbit to get carrots to feed them all. The player gets these carrots by jumping around in their game.

Mechanics: The player moves with "A," "D," and "Space." They can also pause the game with "Esc" and talk to rabbits with "E." There is a main menu that leads to the game, a tutorial, and the credits. Additionally, there are pause menus on both the game and the tutorial. Those two menus, as well as the normal dialogue, requires a mouse to navigate/move on to the next line. The player collects carrots by walking into/jumping onto them, and does not need to interact in a special way to pick them up. There is a bit of text in the upper left corner of the game and tutorial screens that indicates how many carrots you currently have.

Aesthetics: The aesthetics of this game are simple and easy to look at, while still being pretty. All assets, including the font, are done in pixel art. There are two sprites, the player and the NPC, that are distinguishable as the NPC is always standing and the player is always sitting (while idle). Both the NPC and player have well defined animations, where the NPC looks to the side occasionally, and the player runs when running, jumps when jumping, and sits (flicking its ear and occasionally blinking) when idle. The music is high-ish tempo while remaining relaxing, adding to the feel of the game. There are also sounds that come from jumping and collecting carrots, which will provide immediate feedback to the player. Lastly, when the player changes directions, jumps, or lands, it lets up a cloud of dust.

Joys and Struggles: 

Fin - I had a very good time with this project, which I initially thought would not turn out to be the case. I really like how it turned out, both aesthetically and mechanically. I did still struggle with Unity, as it sometimes came up with errors than required me to completely delete and re-clone the project.

Contributions:

Fin - I put in all the assets (I did not find all of them), and I found the bunny and vegetable sprites. I made the animations for both the idle and moving rabbits. I also made the particle effects from movement. I then made the main menu and pause menus, as well as all of their attached functionality. Lastly, I also made the dialogue systems.
